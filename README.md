Using a dataset of motion sensor values for movement recording with parameters acquired by motion sensors, we have identified the most prominent features for future classification and ailment detection.
The data is a time-series dataset that is collected from a set of sensors. 

It has 19,000 samples and 81 features along with missing values (NA) and some outliers. We will use data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to deal with these.

We have compared PCA, LDA and Naive Bayes methods for dimensionality reduction into two-dimensional data for feature extraction based on their variance. We have compared the first and second principal components and also the 5th and 6th principal components. The results proved that initial principal components are more distinguishable than the latter ones.
